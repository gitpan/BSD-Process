INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Building this module requires a FreeBSD system and a C compiler.
Support for OpenBSD and NetBSD will appear in future releases.

TESTING

This module requires the following module for thorough testing:

    Test::More

This module will use the following modules if they are available:
(their absence is not a problem).

    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage

It can also make use of Devel::Cover if available.

UNINSTALLATION

This Perl module has components which will be found in the following
directories:

  .../perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/mach/auto/BSD/Process/*
  .../perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/mach/BSD/Process.pm
  .../perl5/5.x.x/man/man3/BSD::Process.3

USAGE

    use BSD::Process;

    my $proc = BSD::Process->new;
    print $proc->rssize, " resident set size\n";
    print "This process has made $proc->{minflt}  page reclaims\n";

    print $proc->user_time, " seconds spent on the CPU\n";
    $proc->refresh;
    print "And now $proc->{utime} seconds\n";

There are a few useful programs bundled with the distribution that
won't be installed. If you can't find them on your system, have a
look at the online versions, available at http://search.cpan.org
and/or http://kobesearch.cpan.org .

HELPING

Patches welcome!

If you would like to see this module work on other operating systems,
but don't particularly wish to hack on the source yourself, and you
have a publically accessible machine on the net, and you are fine
with the idea of giving me an account on said machine, then drop
me a line.

I will send you my public key for connecting via ssh. All I need
is a shell and a C compiler, and I give you my word that I will not
do anything evil. If required, I will connect only from a fixed
address (which would allow you to set up an AllowUsers USER@HOST
rule in your sshd_config file).
